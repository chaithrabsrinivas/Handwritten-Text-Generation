# Handwritten Text Generation

## Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of generating realistic handwritten-style text. The goal is to create synthetic handwriting that mimics human writing patterns in terms of coherence, readability, and visual appearance.

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of handwritten text samples.
- Ensure the dataset (`handwriting_data/`) is placed in the `dataset/` folder.
- The dataset may include:
  - Images of handwritten text
  - Labeled sequences of strokes and coordinates
  - Corresponding textual representations

## Project Structure

```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/handwritten-text-generation.git
   cd handwritten-text-generation
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Preprocess and Train Model**
   Run the `train_handwriting_model.py` script to train the generative model:
   ```bash
   python src/train_handwriting_model.py
   ```
   This will save trained models in the `models/` directory.

2. **Generate Handwritten Text**
   Load a trained model and generate new handwritten-style text:
   ```python
   import joblib
   import numpy as np
   
   model = joblib.load('models/handwriting_model.pkl')
   input_text = "Hello, world!"
   generated_text = model.generate(input_text)
   print("Generated Handwriting:", generated_text)
   ```

## Model Architecture
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with LSTMs/GRUs**
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**

## Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Learning Rate Adjustments**
- **Sequence Length Optimization**
- **Layer Depth Customization**

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Coherence of Generated Text**
- **Readability Score**
- **Similarity to Actual Handwriting (using Image Metrics like SSIM)**
